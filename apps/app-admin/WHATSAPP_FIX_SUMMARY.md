# WhatsApp Bot Fix Summary

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Assistant Recreation Issue (FIXED)
**Problem**: Assistant was being recreated on every message instead of being cached
- Assistant ID was not persisting between requests
- Multiple assistants created (asst_K635..., asst_zv6l...) causing context loss

**Solution**: 
- Implemented proper promise-based singleton pattern for assistant creation
- Added `assistantCreationPromise` to handle concurrent requests
- Assistant is now created once and reused for all messages

### 2. Thread Management Issue (FIXED)  
**Problem**: New threads being created for the same user
- Phone number normalization was inconsistent
- Threads not being properly cached per user

**Solution**:
- Normalized phone numbers consistently (remove +, spaces, dashes)
- Phone number normalized at entry point before any processing
- Consistent format used throughout the application

### 3. Missing Tool Implementation (FIXED)
**Problem**: `selectJob` tool was defined but not implemented
- When user typed "1" to select a job, the tool call failed
- Bot got stuck with no response

**Solution**:
- Removed unused `selectJob` tool definition
- Updated assistant instructions to use `confirmJobSelection` directly
- Added clear mapping instructions for job number to job ID

### 4. Improved Error Handling
- Added detailed logging for tool calls
- Better error messages for debugging
- Timeout handling for slow responses

## Key Changes Made

1. **route.ts line 37-39**: Added promise-based assistant caching
```typescript
let assistantId: string | null = null;
let isCreatingAssistant = false;
let assistantCreationPromise: Promise<string> | null = null;
```

2. **route.ts line 105-108**: Normalized phone numbers at entry
```typescript
const rawPhone = data.fromNumber || data.from;
const phoneNumber = rawPhone?.replace(/[\s+-]/g, '').replace(/^0+/, '') || '';
```

3. **route.ts line 334-348**: Fixed assistant creation pattern
```typescript
if (!assistantId) {
  if (!assistantCreationPromise) {
    assistantCreationPromise = createAssistant();
  }
  assistantId = await assistantCreationPromise;
}
```

4. **Removed selectJob tool** and updated instructions for proper job selection flow

## Testing Instructions

1. Send "hello" to the bot
2. Provide name and phone number when asked
3. Select a job by typing its number (e.g., "1")
4. Confirm the job selection
5. Continue with the inspection workflow

## Expected Behavior

- Assistant should be created only once per server instance
- Each phone number should maintain one thread throughout conversation
- Job selection should work seamlessly without getting stuck
- Context should be preserved throughout the conversation

## Monitor These Logs

- `ðŸ”§ Creating assistant for first time...` - Should appear only once
- `ðŸ“Œ Using cached assistant:` - Should appear for all subsequent messages
- `ðŸ†• Created thread` - Should appear once per unique phone number
- `ðŸ”§ Tool call requested:` - Shows which tools are being called
