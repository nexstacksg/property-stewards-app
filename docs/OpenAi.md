Yes, you can use **Thread IDs** to manage and retrieve memory context when working with the **OpenAI Assistants API** (which powers features like memory). Here's how it works:

---

### ‚úÖ What is a Thread ID?

A `Thread ID` in the Assistants API uniquely identifies a conversation thread. It stores all the messages and memory associated with that conversation, allowing OpenAI to:

- Remember past interactions (if memory is enabled)
- Retrieve contextual information
- Enable a persistent state across API calls

---

### üß† How to Use Thread ID for Memory

1. **Create a Thread** (or use an existing one):

   ```http
   POST https://api.openai.com/v1/threads
   ```

2. **Send Messages to a Thread**:

   ```http
   POST /v1/threads/{thread_id}/messages
   {
     "role": "user",
     "content": "What's my project status?"
   }
   ```

3. **Run the Assistant on the Thread**:

   ```http
   POST /v1/threads/{thread_id}/runs
   {
     "assistant_id": "asst_abc123"
   }
   ```

4. **Memory is tied to the thread**: If the Assistant has memory **enabled**, it will remember past messages and store structured memory.

---

### üìå Check Memory from a Thread

You can **retrieve memory data** (if enabled for that assistant):

```http
GET /v1/assistants/{assistant_id}/memory
```

Or if scoped to a thread (if supported), you would inspect:

```http
GET /v1/threads/{thread_id}
```

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Notes

- Memory must be **enabled** in the Assistant configuration.
- You can **delete**, **update**, or **inspect** memory via the API.
- You can also use the `/v1/assistants/{assistant_id}/tools` endpoint to include retrieval tools (like files or functions).
